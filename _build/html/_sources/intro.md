# Quantitative project working practices information and guidance

Welcome to the Dartington Service Design Lab quantitative research project working practices information and guidance. This document has been prepared as a way to support collaborative, open source, transparent and replicable working on quantitative projects across the organisation.

This guidance has been developed to align with modern data science best working practices and open source principles. Organisations across the UK including the NHS, Office for National Statistics and UK Government conduct their data science work in alignment with their open source policies. As such, utilising the working principles decribed here will help ensure that our work and outputs are suitably aligned to the standard practices across the sector

## Why open source?
